# Experiment 5: Priority Scheduling

This folder contains my lab work on preemptive and non-preemptive priority scheduling. This experiment shows how a scheduler can use a process's priority to determine its execution order.

### **Project Overview**

- **Objective:** To implement and compare the performance of preemptive and non-preemptive priority-based scheduling.
- **Key Concepts:** The assignment explores how processes with higher priorities can preempt lower-priority tasks and analyzes the impact on response time and turnaround time. It also discusses the problem of starvation.
- **Technology:** This project is implemented in Python.

### **File Contents**

- `OS-somish exp 5.pdf`: The lab report, including the code, output tables, and Gantt charts for both preemptive and non-preemptive priority scheduling.
