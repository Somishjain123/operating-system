# Experiment 6: Round Robin CPU Scheduling

This folder contains my implementation of the **Round Robin (RR)** CPU scheduling algorithm. The experiment simulates a time-sharing system and analyzes how the time quantum affects performance.

### **Project Overview**

- **Objective:** To implement a Round Robin scheduler and evaluate its fairness and efficiency.
- **Key Concepts:** The assignment explores concepts like time quantum, context switching, and the ability of RR to provide fair CPU allocation, preventing process starvation.
- **Technology:** This project is implemented in Python.

### **File Contents**

- `OS-somish exp 6.pdf`: The lab report with the Python code, a results table, and a Gantt chart visualizing the execution flow.
