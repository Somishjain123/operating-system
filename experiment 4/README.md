# Experiment 4: Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling (SRTF & SJF)

This folder contains my lab work on preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling algorithms. The experiment compares the performance of **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** and **Shortest Job First (SJF)**.

### **Project Overview**

- **Objective:** To implement and analyze both preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling policies.
- **Key Concepts:** The assignment demonstrates how SRTF and SJF prioritize jobs based on burst time to minimize waiting time and improve overall efficiency. The code also generates a Gantt chart to visualize the scheduling process.
- **Technology:** This project is implemented in Python.

### **File Contents**

- `OS-somish exp 4.pdf`: The full lab report with the Python code, output tables, and Gantt charts for both algorithms.
