# Operating Systems Assignments

This repository contains my academic assignments and lab work from my Operating Systems course. The projects are designed to demonstrate a foundational understanding of key OS concepts and principles.

### **Repository Structure**

The assignments are organized into individual folders, with each folder containing the assignment file and a dedicated README.md that provides specific context and a summary of the work.

- **`Experiment-1`**: A theoretical assignment on the fundamentals of operating systems, including different OS types and their core components.
- **`Experiment-2`**: A lab on system calls and process management, exploring concepts like `fork()`, `exec()`, and file I/O.
- **`Experiment-3`**: An implementation of the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) CPU scheduling algorithm, including a Gantt chart visualization.
- **`Experiment-4`**: An exploration of preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling, specifically Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) and Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithms.
- **`Experiment-5`**: A study on priority scheduling, comparing preemptive and non-preemptive implementations.
- **`Experiment-6`**: An implementation of the Round Robin (RR) CPU scheduling algorithm, analyzing its performance with a time quantum.
- **`Experiment-7`**: A lab on thread synchronization and concurrency, implementing classic locks like Peterson's Lock and Compare-and-Swap.

### **Skills Highlighted**

- **Process Scheduling**: Implementation and analysis of various CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, RR, SJF, Priority).
- **Process Management**: Understanding of process creation, communication, and synchronization.
- **Concurrency**: Principles of threading and concurrency control using different locking mechanisms.
- **System Calls**: Practical experience with low-level OS services like file I/O and process control.
- **Python Programming**: Practical application of OS concepts through Python code.

This repository serves as a portfolio of my work in this subject, showcasing both my theoretical understanding and my hands-on implementation skills.
