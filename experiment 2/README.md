# Experiment 2: System Calls and Process Management

This folder contains my lab work on system calls and process management. The experiment focuses on understanding how user programs interact with the operating system's kernel.

### **Assignment Overview**

- **Objective:** To implement and analyze the behavior of key system calls in a C program.
- **Key Concepts:** This assignment explores file I/O using `open()`, `read()`, and `write()`; process creation with `fork()`; and process execution with `exec()`. It also covers the differences between system calls and function calls.

### **File Contents**

- `OS-somish exp 2.pdf`: The complete lab report, including the C code, outputs, and answers to the assessment questions.
