# Experiment 7: Thread Synchronization and Concurrency

This folder contains my lab work on thread synchronization and concurrency. The experiment demonstrates how different locking mechanisms are used to protect shared resources in a multi-threaded environment.

### **Project Overview**

- **Objective:** To implement and analyze classic synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions.
- **Key Concepts:** The assignment explores and implements **Peterson's Lock**, **Test-and-Set Lock (TAS)**, and **Compare-and-Swap (CAS)** locks. The code simulates multiple threads accessing and modifying a shared variable.
- **Technology:** This project is implemented in Python using the `threading` module.

### **File Contents**

- `OS-somish exp 7.pdf`: The lab report, including the Python code, and the output showing the trace of how each thread updated the shared variable.
