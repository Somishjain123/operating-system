# Experiment 3: FCFS CPU Scheduling

This folder contains my implementation of the **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** CPU scheduling algorithm. The project simulates how processes are managed in a non-preemptive environment.

### **Project Overview**

- **Objective:** To implement and analyze the FCFS scheduling algorithm.
- **Key Concepts:** This assignment explores CPU scheduling, process metrics (Waiting Time, Turnaround Time, Response Time), and Gantt charts. The code dynamically fetches job data from an external API to simulate real-world scenarios.
- **Technology:** This project is implemented in Python.

### **File Contents**

- `OS-somish exp 3.pdf`: The lab report, including the Python code, the FCFS summary table, and a generated Gantt chart.
